# Advent of Code 2020
Poorly coded solutions for Advent of Code 2020

This is my second Advent of Code, having joined last year about 17 days in and having to rush a lot of solutions in a few short days while also going on vacation. This year I look forward to doing the puzzles each day and trying to complete all 50 stars. I don't expect to be on the leaderboard though it would be fun.

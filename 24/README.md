# Day 24

Part 1 was an excellent puzzle. The hexagonal grid threw me for a loop and took a few minutes to figure out how to represent it but once I found the trick this was straightforward and I felt accomplished.


Part 2 was also pretty simple since we've seen Conway's Game of Life twice already, for for that same reason I was not very pleased to see this puzzle. I lost focus while implementing it and I was stymied by extremely an buggy implementation.

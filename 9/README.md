# Day 9

Part 1 was easy as it was very similar to the problem from day 1. Even though my day 1 solution wasn't efficient, it was fine to adapt it for this problem.


Part 2 was also pretty straightforward. I'm sure my solution isn't the most efficient one but it was simple to just keep checking increasing ranges until either I found the goal or exceeded it. I got stuck for some time because I was submitting the sum of the first and last numbers in the range even though the puzzle requests the sum of the highest and lowest. After this problem I was a lot more careful to read what the actual submission criterion are!

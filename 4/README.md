# Day 4

I solved part 1 pretty easily using a state machine to know if I was processing the same passport, then validating the whole thing when I saw a blank line. By this point some friends and I were getting into this and sharing our solutions on Github so I had the silly idea to replace my variable names with their usernames just to see if they would notice (they did, and we had a good laugh)


Part 2 was not very fun because it was just implementing a bunch of rules. I ended up with some spaghetti nest of if statements and it was easy to have hard to find bugs. I relied heavily on the smaller example datasets to debug the code.

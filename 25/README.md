# Day 25

This was a nice puzzle to cap off the event. I could tell the problem was fairly simple in terms of implementation but it was shrouded in a lot of words and rules. I had a few bugs where I just misunderstood which value was being used for what.


Suspiciously, the value in the loop is the remainder when divided by "20201227", which happens to be the date two days after this puzzle was released. Is this just a convenience number to get the math to work in the puzzle, or is this a hint that something else will happen on the 27th?

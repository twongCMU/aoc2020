# Day 10

Part 1 was pretty easy. I sorted the adapters and then made a histogram.


Part 2 was much hardware but I enjoyed it. I chose a memoization solution but I hadn't used memoization since I was preparing for job interviews a year prior. It took a bit of time to work out on paper how to actually keep track of the information I wanted but I'm pretty proud that I was able to work it out without having to get outside help.

I also think this is wonderful:
